        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Today we are making vegan green curry with air fried tofu and vegetables. This dish is perfect for fall and winter months. My girlfriend and I love making a big pot of this and having it for lunch throughout the week. This is cheap to make and you can add or substitute any vegetables to your liking. You can also make this as mild or spicy as you'd like.</p>

        <p>I'm not the kind of person to ramble, and one of my internet pet peeves is the recipes with more backstory than actual cooking instructions so let's get into it.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>14oz cans of coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Thai Kitchen Green Curry paste</li>
            <li>1 block tofu (firm or extra firm)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 medium zucchini</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lime juice (squeezed)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp avocado oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 dash of crushed chili peppers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Press the tofu to remove the water. Cut into ~1" cubes</li>

            <li>Cut bell peppers and zucchini into 1" cubes and add to curry.</li>
            <li>Bring curry to boil and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
