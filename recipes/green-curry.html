        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Today we are making vegan green curry with air fried tofu and vegetables. This dish is perfect for fall and winter months. My girlfriend and I love making a big pot of this and having it for lunch throughout the week. This is cheap to make and you can add or substitute any vegetables to your liking. You can also make this as mild or spicy as you'd like.</p>

        <p>I'm not the kind of person to ramble, and one of my internet pet peeves is the recipes with more backstory than actual cooking instructions so let's get into it.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 8oz cans of coconut milk</li>
            <li>4 Thai Kitchen Green Curry paste</li>
        </ul>
